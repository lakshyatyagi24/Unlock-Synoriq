* Spread operator is used to split array or object properties.
* syntax `...`
* Merge operator is used to merge array/list.
* syntax `...`
###### Tutorial 19
* Destructing easily extract array/object propoerty and store that in a variable.
###### Tutorial 20
* Object reference the value (copy the pointer).

###### Tutorial 22

###### Tutorial 23
* MDN Documentation: [ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/)
