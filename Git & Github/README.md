#### Summary of Course
###### Tutorial 1
* Git is a Distributed Version Control System. Very useful in Team Work. Easy to solve conflicts and keep all history. Also, it is open source.
* Github is a kind of cloud storage that keeps our repository. It also provides backup. It's a Graphical User Interface that's why it is easy to use for anyone.

* Use `git init` to initialize git.
* Use `git status` to get the states of a working folder and it will also tell you stagged and unstaged files.
* `git add filename` is used to know which file needs to be staged in the next commit.
* `git commit -m "commit message"` is used to do commits in the main repository
* `git remote add origin "repository git link"` used to know the commits need to be the push in origin.
* Push all your commits in the master branch using `git push -u origin master`
* Use `git --help` to see all available commands.
###### Tutorial 3

###### Tutorial 4
* Use this command to put git-completion.bash script in your home directory `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash`
* Use command `vi ~/.bash_profile` to edit .bash_profile file and add these lines
```
if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then
  . ~/.git-completion.bash
fi
```
* `git config color.ui` is used to check wether coloring is on (true) or off (false)
* Use `git config --global color.ui true` to turn on coloring and `git config --global color.ui true` to turn of coloring.
###### Tutorial 5
* Branching is a very useful way to review whether the change is useful or not. Always preferred to make a different branch and do changes to it.
* create a new branch using `git branch "branch name"` and use `git checkout "branch name"` to switch branch.
* Let's merge new branch in master branch using `git merge "branch name need to merge in master"`.
* Need to use push command to check on github.
* Use `git branch -d "branch name"` to delete any branch. (You can't delete master branch).
###### Tutorial 6
* Go to settings of particular repository and click on "Integration and Services" and add "Email" service.
* Add your email id in "Address" input box.
###### Tutorial 7
* Normally we use tagging in git for marking stable release.
* Use `git tag "tag name"` to create tag.
* Use `git tag` to get the list of all tags.
* Don't forget to push tags to remote repository.
* To delete any tag use `git tag -d "tag name"` or you can use `git tag --delete "tag name"`
