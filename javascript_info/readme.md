###### Tutorial 1
* Due to ECMAScript, JavaScript became a fully independent language.
* JavaScript can run in any JavaScript engine. It can be a browser, server, or Device.
* JavaScript is responsible for all the changes that happen after the loading of the whole website.
###### Tutorial 2
* MDN is the best documentation for any language.
* JavaScript is a developing language.
###### Tutorial 3
* We have 2 types of editors IDE and Lightweight editors.
* IDE consists of all major functions.
* Lightweight editors are sweet and simple.
###### Tutorial 4
* Use developer tools to see an error in the browser.
* To write multiline code in console use `shift+enter`.
###### Tutorial 5
* We insert/write JavaScript code inside <script> tag.
* JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.
* We use `//` for single line comment and `/* */` for multiline comment.
* We can't use a nested multiline comment.
