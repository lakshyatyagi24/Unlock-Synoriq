###### Tutorial 1
* Due to ECMAScript, JavaScript became a fully independent language.
* JavaScript can run in any JavaScript engine. It can be a browser, server, or Device.
* JavaScript is responsible for all the changes that happen after the loading of the whole website.
###### Tutorial 2
* MDN is the best documentation for any language.
* JavaScript is a developing language.
###### Tutorial 3
* We have 2 types of editors IDE and Lightweight editors.
* IDE consists of all major functions.
* Lightweight editors are sweet and simple.
###### Tutorial 4
* Use developer tools to see an error in the browser.
* To write multiline code in console use `shift+enter`.
###### Tutorial 5
* We insert/write JavaScript code inside `<script>` tag.
* JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.
* We use `//` for single line comment and `/* */` for multiline comment.
* We can't use a nested multiline comment.
###### Tutorial 6
* We use 'use script' to work the modern javascript way.
###### Tutorial 7
* Variable is used to store data.
* Use the let keyword to declare the variable.
* var is an old method to declare variables.
* variable can't be declared again with the same name.
* first character of the variable can't be a number.
* Case sensitive.
* const declares an unchangeable variable.
###### Tutorial 8
* basic data types we have in JS.
* String, Number, Big Int, Boolean, null, undefined, Object, Symbol.
* Special Numeric Values "Infinity", "-Infinity" and NaN.
###### Tutorial 9
* Alert will show a message and wait for user response.
* prompt returns the text entered by the user. If the user doesn't enter any text it will return null.
* confirm comes like a question in a model.
###### Tutorial 10
* Use `String(value)` for string conversion.
* Automatic conversion of string to number if we apply `/` to a numeric string.
###### Tutorial 11
* `%` is used for the reminder.
* `**` is used for exponentiation.
* We can concatenate string using `+`.
* `+` is also used to convert non-numbers.
* Operator work in precedence.
* `=` is used as an assignment operator.
* `++` is used for increment and `--` is used for decrement by 1.
* Bitwise return in bool.
