#### Summary of Course
###### Tutorial 1

> git push - Push all the commits to the remote repository.<br>
> git fetch - Fetch all the changes/files to the local repository from the remote repository.<br>
###### Tutorial 2
* Clone git reposittory means to download and use the repository from remote to local.

###### Tutorial 3

* While Pushing choose local repo branch, Remote repo branch, and Destination (Origin if you want to commit in same repo).
###### Tutorial 4
* Use tortoise git fetch option.
* Select remote branch/repository.
* The fetched file needs to be merged in a local branch.
###### Tutorial 5
* To create a new branch you need to be present in a master branch.
* Go to the branches write a branch name and click on create branch "branch name".
* While creating a new branch is always the same as the master branch at that time.
* After creating a new branch it will fetch a new branch too in the local repository.
* Use tortoise git switch/checkout to change the branch in the local repository.
* We also have an option to change the branch name while changing the branch.
* If you are using HTTPS it will ask for credentials but if you are working with SSH it will not ask for credentials.
